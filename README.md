<p id="description">A full-stack web application that uses the MERN stack for the backend and frontend smart contracts for blockchain integration and Jupyter Notebooks for AI functionalities. The project focuses on managing car-related data and predicting car prices.</p>

This project leverages modern web technologies to create a comprehensive system for managing vehicle histories and predicting vehicle prices. The application includes the following key features:

- Smart Contract Integration: Uses Ethereum smart contracts to securely store and manage the history of vehicle maintenance and accidents on the blockchain. This ensures the data is tamper-proof and transparently accessible.
- AI for Price Prediction: Implements AI models to predict vehicle prices based on historical data and various vehicle attributes.
